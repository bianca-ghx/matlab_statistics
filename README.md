# Matlab Statistics

This project was developed for the Matlab and its Applications in Engineering course at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The name of the project, RandX, has been chosen to represent the key element of estimation theory, the random component. The final version of this project will be a GUI where the user will only need to enter a few parameters in order to obtain information and visualizations for different statistical concepts. This project does not mean to yield a tool that can be used only in an isolated domain of estimation theory but to provide a general-purpose application that can be used efficiently in many different fields.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/matlab_statistics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd matlab_statistics
    ```
3. Open the Matlab application files (`.mlapp`) in Matlab.

## Usage
To use the statistical analysis system, follow these instructions:

1. Open Matlab.
2. Load and run the `MainMenu.mlapp` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the GUI to select and input parameters for various statistical analyses, including random variables, parameter estimation, and statistical detection.
